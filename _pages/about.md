I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield.

I am interested in various areas of Natural Language Processing including coreference resolution, text generation, end-to-end reasoning, robustness and generalization, sustainability, and reliable evaluation. 

Before joining the University of Sheffield, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Iryna Gurevych at [the UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Before that, I got my PhD degree from Heidelberg University where I was supervised by Prof. Michael Strube.
