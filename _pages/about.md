I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield.
Before joining the University of Sheffield, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Iryna Gurevych at [the UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University of Darmstadt. I got my PhD degree from Heidelberg University where I was supervised by Prof. Michael Strube. I have studied at Alzahra University and the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran for my BSc and MSc in computer science. 



Reseach Interests
------
If you are a self-funded Ph.D. student and would like to work with me, I am interested to work on evaluating and improving (1) fairness & robustness, (2) accessibility, (3) reasoning skills, and (4) efficiency of language models. 
Apart from these, I am interested in coreference resolution and interesting psycholinguistic analyses of text ot multimodal inputs.
