I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield.

I am interested in various areas of Natural Language Processing including coreference resolution, text generation, end-to-end reasoning, robustness and generalization, sustainability, and reliable evaluation. 

Before joining the University of Sheffield, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Iryna Gurevych at [the UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Before that, I got my PhD degree from Heidelberg University where I was supervised by Prof. Michael Strube.



Reseach Interests
------
If you are a self-funded Ph.D. student and would like to work with me, I am interested to work on evaluating and improving (1) fairness & robustness, (2) accessibility, (3) reasoning skills, and (4) efficiency of language models. 
Apart from these, I am interested in coreference resolution and interesting psycholinguistic analyses on Twitter data. 

In Sheffield, we have many great academics who work on hate speech, fact-checking and fake news detection, but I am not one of them :) You can check my colleagues and their research interests [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing).

If you are not self-funded, I don't currently have an open position, but you can instead apply for our [Center for Doctoral Training for Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.sheffield.ac.uk/).
